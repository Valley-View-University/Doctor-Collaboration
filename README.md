# Doctor-Collaboration
Application to enhance interaction between Doctors.

This is an application for Software Engineering Class Semester One 2016 of Valley View University.

The application will enable Doctors post information as well as request information from other Doctors. 
Information posted will be grouped into several categories such that it can easily be searched and referenced. 
It will also enable one-on-one chat for private conversations between the doctors.
